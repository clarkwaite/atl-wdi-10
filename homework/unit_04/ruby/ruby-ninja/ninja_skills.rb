# The Final Challenge: Prime Numbers

# Write a method called check_prime? that will test whether a number is Prime. The method will return true if Prime, false if not.

# Write another method called get_primes that will print all the Primes up to an arbitrary limit. For example, if you invoke your method with get_primes(100), it will print all the Prime numbers up to and including 100.

# This method can call on the previous check_prime? method.

# A Prime number is a number that is not evenly divisible by another number except 1 and itself.
# To test whether a number is Prime, you only need to test as far as the square root of that number. This is advisable for optimization and testing large numbers.
